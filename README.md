- Input and output redirection using `<` and `>` operators.
- Built-in commands: `cd` for changing the current working directory and `exit` for quitting the shell.
- Basic error handling.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- C compiler (e.g., GCC) installed on your system.

## How to Compile

To compile the simple shell, use the following command:

```shell
gcc -o simple_shell simple_shell.c
